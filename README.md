Employee Management System (EMS)
📌 Project Overview

The Employee Management System (EMS) is a full-stack web application developed as part of an Assignment for the Advanced Full-Stack Programming course at Conestoga College.

The application allows users to manage employee records efficiently, including viewing, adding, updating, filtering, and enforcing business rules such as preventing the deletion of active employees and tracking upcoming retirements.

The project is implemented as a monorepo, containing both the backend API and frontend UI.
